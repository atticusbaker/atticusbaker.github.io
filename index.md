## About Me
I am a Student at CU Boulder, and I am excited to continue my journey in earth science! I come from central Colorado, and I have always loved geology and geography. I had a job as a caving tour guide in high school, which made me want to persue geology as a career. I also have always loved computer maps. My internship at NOAA taught me some of the skills to earth data management so taking GEOG 4463 is super exciting for me!

I am interested in learning more about how to efficiently convey earth data, and how to quickly make products to help in the earth sciences.

One question I want to answer with earth data science is: How can we use remote sensing data to mitigate the effects of climate change?
